My workflow in Windsurf when trying out new stuff or creating POC. 

1. I ask for my AI assistant to create project folder named "testproject" with idea.md file and open that in Windsurf
2. Then in Windsurf I write my idea of application to idea.md
3. I tell Claude to read idea.md and make plan.md with step by step instructions to implementation and not to do anything else before I accept plan
4. Back and forth discussion about tech stack etc
5. When plan sounds good I tell Claude to go ahead and implement
6. I go make some coffee or vibecode with Cursor / Aider / Cline when Claude is working in Windsurf :)
