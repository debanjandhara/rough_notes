### **Business Layer (Input)**
These are product-driven deliverables, extracted or clarified from the BRD for the "ArchitectPulse" Smart CRM System.

---

### **Deliverable: Business Goals**
*High-level outcomes the system is intended to achieve for the clients and the platform itself.*

1.  **Streamline Legal Case Management (for InnerWorks):** To move InnerWorks from a manual, document-heavy process to a centralized digital platform. This will reduce administrative overhead, prevent missed deadlines, and improve internal workflow efficiency between different lawyer tiers (Admin, Head Lawyers, Subordinate Lawyers).

2.  **Enhance Client Communication and Transparency (for InnerWorks):** To provide InnerWorks' non-technical clients with timely and automated updates on their case progress, solving the problem of reactive follow-ups and lack of preparation time. The potential WhatsApp integration is a key enabler for this goal.

3.  **Centralize and Digitize Information:** To eliminate the reliance on hard-copy documents by creating a single source of truth for all case-related files and information. This is critical for enabling seamless collaboration between internal (firm) and external (contract) lawyers.

4.  **Create a Flexible and Modular CRM Platform (for "ArchitectPulse"):** To build a core system that is not limited to one industry. The goal is to serve distinct verticals, such as the legal sector (InnerWorks) and e-commerce (NeuEarth Technologies), by allowing for customizable workflows, potentially managed via APIs.

5.  **Enable Standard CRM Functionality for General Business (for NeuEarth):** To provide traditional e-commerce and small businesses with essential CRM tools, including sales pipeline management, contact organization, task tracking, and basic analytics, to help them manage leads and grow their business.

### **Deliverable: Target User Personas**
*Profiles of the key users we are building the system for, based on their roles and needs described in the BRD.*

**Primary Personas (InnerWorks - Legal Module)**

*   **Persona 1: The Firm Administrator (Admin/Director - ADM)**
    *   **Role:** Manages the entire legal firm's operations. Has ultimate oversight.
    *   **Needs:** A high-level dashboard to view all active cases, lawyer assignments, and overall firm performance. Needs the ability to add new clients, create top-level cases, and assign Head Lawyers.
    *   **Pain Points:** Lack of visibility into case progress across the firm; inefficient resource allocation.

*   **Persona 2: The Head Lawyer (HL)**
    *   **Role:** Manages a portfolio of complex cases and leads a team of subordinate lawyers.
    *   **Needs:** A personal dashboard to track the status of their assigned cases (e.g., CASE 11, CASE 12). Must be able to assign and re-assign specific Subordinate Lawyers (both internal SLs and external OLs) to cases.
    *   **Pain Points:** Difficulty tracking the progress of multiple subordinate lawyers on various cases; time wasted on manual follow-ups.

*   **Persona 3: The Subordinate Lawyer (SL / OL)**
    *   **Role:** The primary "doer" who works on the day-to-day tasks of a legal case. Can be an internal employee (SL) or an external contractor (OL).
    *   **Needs:** A clear view of their assigned cases and tasks. Needs a simple way to update progress, log activities, and, most importantly, access and upload case documents digitally.
    *   **Pain Points:** Delays in receiving necessary case documents (hard copies); confusion about deadlines and priorities.

*   **Persona 4: The End-Client (of InnerWorks)**
    *   **Role:** The individual or company whose legal case is being handled.
    *   **Needs:** Simple, proactive, and easy-to-understand updates on their case status. The BRD explicitly states they are **"non-technical,"** so they will not be logging into a complex system.
    *   **Pain Points:** Feeling uninformed about case progress; having to initiate follow-ups to get information.

**Secondary Persona (NeuEarth - General CRM Module)**

*   **Persona 5: The Sales & Marketing Manager**
    *   **Role:** Responsible for managing leads, tracking sales, and coordinating follow-up activities for an e-commerce or small business.
    *   **Needs:** A visual sales pipeline (Lead, Contacted, Proposal, Closed), a centralized contact database, a task manager to schedule follow-ups, and an analytics dashboard to track sales performance.
    *   **Pain Points:** Using spreadsheets to track leads; losing potential sales due to poor follow-up; no clear view of the sales funnel.

### **Deliverable: MVP Scope**
*A prioritized list of features distinguishing what is essential for the first version (MVP - Minimum Viable Product) versus what can be developed later.*

**MVP (Must-Have for V1.0 Launch):**

*   **Core User & Role Management:** Ability to create and manage the different lawyer personas (Admin, HL, SL, OL) with specific permissions.
*   **Basic Case Management:** Functionality to create clients and cases, define case types (Civil, Criminal, etc.), and assign cases to lawyers as per the workflow on Page 6.
*   **Essential Document Management:** Secure upload, storage, and download of documents tied to specific cases. This directly solves a major pain point for InnerWorks.
*   **Simple Task Tracking:** Ability to create tasks within a case, assign them to a lawyer, and mark them as complete.
*   **Centralized Dashboard (Legal Focus):** A basic dashboard for Admins and HLs to view a list of their cases and their current status.

**Post-MVP (Should-Have in a Fast-Follow Release):**

*   **WhatsApp Integration:** Develop and integrate the notification system for non-technical clients. The BRD notes this needs design, indicating its complexity. It's high-value but can follow the core launch.
*   **Standard Sales Pipeline Module:** Build out the visual sales pipeline shown in the mockup for the general CRM users (Client 2). The core contact/task functionality can be shared with the legal module.
*   **Basic Analytics Dashboard:** Implement the visual analytics graph shown in the mockup to display sales or case-closing trends.
*   **Enhanced Reporting:** Ability to generate simple reports (e.g., list of all open cases, lawyer workload).

**Future (Could-Have / Long-Term Vision):**

*   **Public API for Modularity:** Expose a secure API to allow third-party systems or clients to customize and integrate with ArchitectPulse, fulfilling the "modular" vision.
*   **Client-Facing Portal:** A simple, secure web portal where End-Clients can log in to view documents and case status as an alternative to WhatsApp.
*   **Advanced Features:** Time tracking, billing/invoicing integration, full e-commerce platform integrations (e.g., Shopify), and advanced, customizable reporting.
