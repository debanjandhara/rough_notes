## 📈 Visual Progress Tracker (Sample Representation in Excel/Sheets)

To build this:

1. Create a table with topics as rows and days as columns.
2. Use color codes (🟩 = done, 🟨 = in progress, 🟥 = pending).
3. Example structure:

| Topic          | 18 May | 19 May | 20 May | 21 May | 22 May | 23 May | ✅ Progress |
| -------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| Arrays/Strings | 🟩     |        |        |        |        |        | 100%       |
| DBMS           | 🟨     | 🟩     |        |        |        |        | 80%        |
| OS             | 🟩     |        |        |        |        |        | 100%       |
| HR Qs          |        | 🟨     | 🟩     |        | 🟩     |        | 90%        |
| …              |        |        |        |        |        |        |            |
