**Subject: Real Ways to Make Money Online (2025 Perspective)**
**Source:** Video Transcript (Speaker: Taran)
**Date of Video Content:** Implied future (2025)

**I. Introduction & Speaker's Stance (00:00 - 00:48)**
*   Critique of outdated advice (affiliate marketing, captions/subtitles are ineffective in 2025).
*   Promise: Over 25 "real ways" divided into 4 buckets.
*   Context: Many students fail by trying things that don't work due to misinformation.

**II. The Four Buckets of Online Money-Making Methods:**
*   **Bucket 1: Trash (00:17, 01:04 - 02:48):** Things to NEVER try.
    *   **Common Pattern:** Outdated, automated, or dominated by AI.
    *   1.  **Captions & Subtitles:** AI has killed it. (01:04)
    *   2.  **Online Surveys:** Dismissed as "stupid." (01:15)
    *   3.  **Affiliate Marketing:** Trap for students; requires followers, subscribers, and trust â€“ not just dropping links. (01:22)
    *   4.  **Low-level Data Entry Jobs:** AI will replace these; official warning to current workers. (01:40)
    *   5.  **NFT Flipping & Website Testing:** Don't even go near them. (01:54)
