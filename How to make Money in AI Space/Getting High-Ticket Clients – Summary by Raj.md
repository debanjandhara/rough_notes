## ❌ What *Doesn't* Work (For Raj)

| Platform       | Why It Doesn’t Work |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Instagram DMs** | Business owners aren’t actively scrolling IG. It’s not a business-first platform. |
| **X (formerly Twitter)** | Never got leads personally (though others claim success). |

> ✨ Verdict: Don’t rely on Instagram DMs. X is a gray area. Better options exist.

## ✅ What Works – **Free vs Paid Methods**

### 💸 Paid Methods *(Use with Caution)*
- Not recommended if you're just starting out.
- Requires ₹25k–₹40k (or more) upfront.
- Includes:
  - Paid Ads (Google, Meta)
  - Cold outreach tools
  - Lead Gen services

#### ⚠️ Raj’s Warning:
> *"Don’t gamble your savings on ads before making money from your business."*

### 🆓 Free Methods (Highly Recommended)

#### 1. **LinkedIn Outreach (Highly Effective)**
- DO NOT cold DM—your account may get banned.
- Instead:
  - Build chatbots for companies (e.g., using **Tixie Agents**).
  - Create a **video demo**.
  - **Post it on LinkedIn** tagging the company + founder.
  - Let the **companies reach out to you**.

✅ Real Results:
- Sales calls with **MuscleBlaze, Sugar Cosmetics, Dior Travels**, etc.
- Inspired by a friend **Sindu**, who posted chatbot videos for brands like **Paradise, Zomato**.

#### 🔑 Tips:
- Post consistently with genuine solutions.
- If the product is good, the **founder or competitor** may respond.
- Use free tools to build chatbots (or upgrade to paid if possible).
- Avoid spamming messages; let **inbound interest** do the work.

---

#### 2. **Manual Email Marketing**
- Find **email addresses** of business owners.
- Tools to find emails:
  - **Anymail Finder**
  - Leaked lead databases (e.g., 6M email list from 2022)
- Personalize each email:
  - Acknowledge the founder
  - Pitch your product (e.g., AI chatbot)
  - Keep it **short, value-packed, respectful**

📧 Example Subject:  
**“AI Chatbot for Boat Lifestyle”**

📧 Example Body:  
> “Hey Aman, sorry to email directly. I built a chatbot for Boat that works on Insta, your website, and more…”

## 🤝 Commission-Based Lead Gen (Bonus Hybrid Method)
- Raj works with trusted friends who bring leads in exchange for **20–30% commission**.
- No upfront cost = No risk.
- Great for beginners without budget.

---

## ⚠️ Final Tips
- Free methods are **slow but sustainable**.
- Paid methods are **fast but risky**.
- Focus on:
  - **Value creation**
  - **Consistency**
  - **Smart targeting**
