## ðŸ’° Capital Strategy
- Morning Side is **self-funded** (bootstrapped) by:
  - Revenue from AI agency services
  - Profits from education programs
- **No VC funding** (to retain full control)
- All cash flow is **reinvested into software development (SaaS)**

---

## ðŸ§  Strategic Insights

- **Morning Side AI is the core engine** of the entire strategy:
  - It builds authority, funds software, and identifies real use cases
  - Without AI agency success, they couldnâ€™t sell:
    - Education programs
    - Consulting
    - Software tools
- Authority & credibility are *non-negotiable* for selling premium offerings

---

## ðŸ§± Foundation for $100M

1. Build a successful AI agency (Morning Side AI)
2. Use it to:
   - Fund new SaaS products
   - Train and educate clients
   - Discover validated product opportunities
3. Use education + SaaS revenue to scale to $100M

---

## ðŸ’¡ Final Advice from Liam
- Donâ€™t just start an AI agency for $20K/month cash flow.
- Use it as a **launchpad** to dig deeper, identify market needs, and **build scalable products**.
- Real success comes from **being in the space**, not theorizing from outside.
