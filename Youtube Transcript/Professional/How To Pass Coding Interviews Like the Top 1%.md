# Summary

To pass coding interviews, especially at top companies like Google, focus on problem clarification, a simple solution approach, and effective communication.

## Highlights
- 💡 **Less than 1% success**: Achieving a Google job is harder than getting into Harvard. 📉
- ❓ **Clarify the problem**: Always ask questions to ensure you understand the task. 🔍
- 📝 **Start simple**: Begin with a naïve solution before optimizing. 🔧
- 💬 **Communicate clearly**: Discuss your thought process while coding to show understanding. 🗣️
- ⏳ **Handle stuck moments**: Use TODOs to revisit difficult parts later. 🔄
- 📊 **Analyze your code**: Identify bottlenecks in your solution and discuss optimizations. 🚦
- ✅ **Test thoroughly**: Validate your code with manageable test cases to demonstrate correctness. ✔️

## Key Insights
- 🎓 **Elite competition**: The low acceptance rate at companies like Google emphasizes the need for strategic interview preparation, not just practice. Candidates must stand out by mastering interview techniques.
- 🗂️ **Effective problem clarification**: Asking clarifying questions at the beginning not only ensures understanding but showcases communication skills, a key factor in interviews.
- ⚙️ **The power of simplicity**: Starting with a simple solution allows candidates to build confidence and avoid unnecessary complexity, leading to a more effective coding process.
- 🌟 **Communication is key**: Candidates who verbalize their thought process while coding significantly enhance their chances of success, demonstrating both understanding and engagement.
- 🔄 **Embrace the struggle**: When stuck, it’s okay to leave notes in your code. This shows that you are methodical and can return to challenges later, reflecting problem-solving skills.
- 🏗️ **Bottleneck awareness**: By identifying and discussing potential inefficiencies in their code, candidates can exhibit a deeper understanding of algorithms and performance considerations.
- 🔍 **Manageable test cases**: Testing with smaller inputs allows for clarity and thoroughness, ensuring candidates can effectively demonstrate the correctness of their solutions.
