## Step 1: Addressing Dark Circles 🔵

### Causes of Dark Circles 🩸
- **Hyperpigmentation**: Skin under the eyes is darker than the rest of the skin.
- **Blood vessels**: Thinner skin shows blood vessels underneath, causing a dark appearance.

### My First Action 🛏️
- **Sleep more**: I started getting **8-9 hours of sleep** a night (previously 6-7 hours of poor sleep).
- Stopped bad habits like **playing video games** late at night and using **blue light** on my phone before bed.

### Results 🏆
- My dark circles improved by **50%**, but were still visible due to **genetics**.

## Step 2: Using Skincare Products 💧

### Vitamin C Serum 🍊
- Used for **hyperpigmentation** to brighten the under-eye area.
- Result: **Slight improvement**, but dark circles remained somewhat visible.

### Caffeinated Serum ☕
- Helped with **blood vessels** showing under thin skin.
- Result: **Made a noticeable difference**, though dark circles still appear when I don’t get enough sleep.

- My eyes were slightly **yellowish** and not very bright.

## Step 4: Eye Appearance and Squinting 👁️

### Inspiration from Male Models 📸
- Noticed that male models often **squint their eyes** for a **striking look** in photos.
- Squinting slightly **relaxes** the look and makes it more attractive.

### Experimenting with Eyebrows 🧑‍🎤
- Instead of focusing on **squinting my eyes**, I practiced **lowering my eyebrows** to achieve a more **relaxed** and **intense** look.
- Result: Gave my eyes a more **natural** appearance, avoiding the "bug-eye" look.
