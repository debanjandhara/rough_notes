### **How to Get into a Flow State for 6 Hours Daily**  

1️⃣ **Wake Up Before Distractions** 🛌  
   - Most distractions (messages, games) happen later in the day.  
   - Waking up early activates **flow state triggers** and helps deep focus.  

2️⃣ **Avoid Overstimulation** 🚫📱  
   - If you consume high-dopamine activities (YouTube, scrolling), your brain craves them over work.  
   - Cut out distractions in the morning and start working immediately to stay in the **work baseline** state.  

3️⃣ **Optimize Breaks** ⏸️💪  
   - **Don't chase stimulation** (e.g., YouTube) during breaks—it disrupts focus.  
   - Instead, do:  
     - **Focus breathwork** (1-2 sets before returning to work).  
     - **5-minute exercise** (e.g., push-ups) to release **endorphins**, which enhance the flow state.  

⚡ **Key Insight**: Even **1 second of distraction** can ruin your entire day by making your brain chase dopamine instead of deep work. Follow these steps, and you'll unlock **6 hours of uninterrupted focus**! 🚀
