### ⏳ **6️⃣ Paradox of Abundance: Too Much Content, Less Focus**
- Despite the availability of free content, **learning effectively is harder** due to too many choices.
- **Strategy:**  
   - Narrow focus on a niche (e.g., 3D game development).  
   - Avoid using AI during learning phases—build expertise before using AI as an assistant.  
   - Consistency beats instant gratification from AI-generated solutions.

---

### 🎯 **7️⃣ Becoming an Expert in Today’s Era**
- Specialization matters! **Expertise in DBMS, OS, Compiler Design, and System Architecture** can secure long-term success.
- Companies will **always invest in expert developers** even in an AI-dominated era.
- **Goal:** Move toward becoming an **L4/L5+ engineer** or specialist where AI cannot replace expertise.

---

### 📈 **8️⃣ The Optimistic Flip: Better Roles in New Markets**
- Just like Big Tech created high-paying jobs, **AI will generate new high-value roles**.
- While some traditional coding roles may diminish, **AI-driven industries will create new opportunities** that pay more and offer better work.
