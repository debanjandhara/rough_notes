# 📝 Notes on Steve Jobs’ 2005 Stanford Commencement Address

**Speaker:** Steve Jobs (CEO of Apple Computer and Pixar Animation Studios)
**Event:** Stanford University Graduation
**Date:** June 12, 2005
**Theme:** How to live a meaningful life through the lens of three personal stories.

---

## 📖 Introduction
Jobs opens with humility, noting he never graduated from college. He promises "no big deal," just **three stories** from his life. These stories serve as the framework for his philosophy on life, career, and mortality.

---

## 1️⃣ Story One: Connecting the Dots
**Theme:** Trusting intuition and the unpredictable nature of the future.

*   **The Narrative:** Jobs recounts dropping out of Reed College after six months because it was draining his working-class parents' savings and he saw no value in the required courses.
*   **The "Drop-in":** After dropping out, he "dropped in" on classes that actually interested him, specifically a **calligraphy course**. He learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, varying spaces between letter combinations, and the beauty of typography.
*   **The Application:** At the time, this had no practical hope of application. However, **10 years later**, when designing the first Macintosh, he recalled these lessons. The Mac became the first computer with beautiful typography (which Windows later copied).
*   **The Lesson:** You cannot connect the dots of your life looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. You must trust that your current interests and gut instincts will connect down the road.
    *   *Key Quote:* "You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path."

## 2️⃣ Story Two: Love and Loss
**Theme:** Resilience, finding your passion, and the benefits of failure.

*   **The Narrative:** Jobs found what he loved early. He started Apple in his parents' garage at 20. By 30, it was a $2 billion company. Then, **he was fired** after a power struggle with the CEO he had hired (John Sculley).
*   **The Reaction:** He was devastated and a "very public failure." He considered running away from Silicon Valley. However, he realized he **still loved what he did**. The turn of events at Apple hadn't changed that passion.
*   **The Rebirth:** Getting fired turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to him. The "heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again."
    *   During this exile, he started **NeXT**, founded **Pixar** (creating *Toy Story*), and met his wife, Laurene.
    *   Eventually, Apple bought NeXT, bringing Jobs back to Apple, and the technology developed at NeXT became the heart of Apple's renaissance.
*   **The Lesson:** Don't settle. You must find what you love in work and in relationships. Sometimes life hits you with a brick; faith in your work is the only thing that keeps you going.
    *   *Key Quote:* "The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle."

---

## 3️⃣ Story Three: Death
**Theme:** Mortality as a tool for clarity and prioritizing what matters.

*   **The Narrative:** At 17, Jobs read a quote: *"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."*
*   **The Method:** For 33 years, he looked in the mirror every morning and asked: **"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"** If the answer was "No" for too many days in a row, he knew he needed to change something.
*   **The Health Scare:** Jobs shares his diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Initially told it was incurable and he had months to live, a biopsy later revealed it was a rare, surgically curable form. (Note: He survived this specific bout, though the cancer eventually returned years later).
*   **The Perspective:** Facing death stripped away external expectations, pride, and fear of failure. He argues that death is "Life’s change agent," clearing out the old to make way for the new.
*   **The Lesson:** Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by **dogma** (living with the results of other people's thinking).
    *   *Key Quote:* "Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become."

---

## 🔚 Conclusion: The Final Message
Jobs concludes by referencing *The Whole Earth Catalog*, a publication he adored in his youth (describing it as Google in paperback form). On the back cover of their final issue, there was a picture of an early morning country road with the words:

> **"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."**

He interpreted this as a wish for himself, and he passed that wish on to the graduating class.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways & Actionable Advice

1.  **Trust the Process:** Do not worry if your current path doesn't make logical sense right now. Follow your curiosity; the utility will reveal itself later.
2.  **Embrace Failure:** Success can make you rigid. Failure can free you to be creative again. If you lose everything but still have your passion, you can rebuild.
3.  **The Mirror Test:** Use mortality as a decision-making framework. If you are unhappy with your daily life for a sustained period, take action to change it immediately.
4.  **Ignore the Noise:** The opinions of others (dogma) drown out your inner voice. Your intuition is your most valuable asset—follow it above all else.
