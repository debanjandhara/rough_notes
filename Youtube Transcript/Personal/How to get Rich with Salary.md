  * Investment corpus continues to grow post-retirement.
  * Financial independence achieved by 40.
  * At age 60: corpus \~₹6.84 crores, still growing by 85.

#### **The Cost of Freedom**

* Like school exams, you can:

  * Study a bit daily (invest early) and be stress-free later.
  * Or cram last minute (work hard in 40s–60s) and face more stress.
* **Freedom = Planning + Consistent Action Today.**

> **Conclusion:**
> You don’t need to deprive yourself today, nor must you overspend. A balanced approach — modest saving and thoughtful planning — can help you enjoy now *and* retire early.
