# 📚 How to Get Whatever You Want

---

## 🗝️ Main Principle:
- **ASK.**  
  If you master just one art in life, make it the *art of asking*.

> ➡️ **Ask = Know what you want.**

You must be **more than just a good worker** — you must be a **good asker**.

---

## ✨ Three Key Points on Asking and Receiving:

### 1. Asking is the Beginning of Receiving
- Asking starts a **unique mental and emotional process**.
- You don't need to know *how* it works — it just **works**.
- 🌱 Some study roots, others pick fruits. Focus on **picking fruits**.

---

### 2. Receiving is Automatic
- Receiving is **not** the problem — **failing to ask** is the problem.
- Example:  
  A hardworking person without written goals = **Good worker, poor asker**.

---

### 3. Success is Abundant
- Success is like an **ocean**, not rationed.
- Problem:  
  Some people approach the ocean with a **teaspoon** instead of a **bucket**.  
  ➡️ Think bigger. Dream bigger. Ask bigger.

## 🧠 Two Ways to Ask:

### 1. Ask with Intelligence
- Be **clear** and **specific**.
- Define exactly:
  - How wide? How high?
  - How soon? When?
  - What size? What color? How much?
- 🎯 Detailed goals **pull you** like a magnet.

---

### 2. Ask with Faith
- Believe **like a child**, not like a skeptical adult.
- **Formula:**  
  ➡️ *Make plans like an adult, but believe like a child.*

---

## 📅 Action Challenge:
- Try this new approach for **90 days**.  
  You can always go back if it doesn't work (but it will).

> 🌟 **Don't just wish for a better future — ASK for it and work toward it.**
