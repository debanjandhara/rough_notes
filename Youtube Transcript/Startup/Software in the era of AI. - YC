Here are the notes from the video lecture.

### Introduction to Software and its Evolution

*   **Andrej Karpathy**, former Director of AI at Tesla, discusses **"Software in the era of AI."**
*   The current period is unique for entering the tech industry due to rapid changes in software.
*   Software, which remained fundamentally unchanged for ~70 years, has undergone two major shifts in the last few years.
*   **Map of GitHub** is introduced as a visualization of the vast landscape of existing software (Software 1.0).

### The Three Eras of Software

*   **Software 1.0**:
    *   Defined by **computer code** written by humans to program computers.
    *   This paradigm dates back to the **~1940s**.
*   **Software 2.0**:
    *   Defined by the **weights** of **neural networks**.
    *   Instead of writing explicit code, developers tune datasets and use optimizers to generate the model's parameters.
    *   **HuggingFace Model Atlas** is the "GitHub for Software 2.0," visualizing these neural network weights.
    *   Early examples, like **AlexNet** (~2012), were fixed-function neural networks.
*   **Software 3.0**:
    *   Defined by **prompts**.
    *   **Large Language Models (LLMs)** are a new type of programmable computer.
    *   They are programmed using natural language (e.g., English), making it a new kind of programming paradigm.

### Practical Examples and the Shift in Software Development

*   **Sentiment Classification Example**:
    *   **Software 1.0**: Requires writing explicit Python code with keyword lexicons.
    *   **Software 2.0**: Involves training a binary classifier on a large dataset of labeled examples.
    *   **Software 3.0**: Uses a simple, few-shot prompt to instruct an LLM to perform the task.
*   **Software "Eating" the Stack**:
    *   **Software 2.0 eating Software 1.0**: Seen in Tesla's Autopilot, where traditional C++ code was progressively replaced by more capable neural networks.
    *   **Software 3.0 eating Software 1.0/2.0**: A new layer of abstraction where natural language prompts control the underlying software.
*   Karpathy’s viral tweet, **"The hottest new programming language is English,"** encapsulates this paradigm shift.

### LLMs as a New Computing Paradigm

*   **Analogy to Utilities**:
    *   LLMs require high **CAPEX** (like building a power grid) and **OPEX** (to serve intelligence).
    *   They offer **metered access** (e.g., per token) and face "intelligence brownouts" when services are down.
*   **Analogy to Fabs**:
    *   LLM development involves huge **CAPEX**, deep R&D, and proprietary secrets.
    *   The hardware dependency (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs vs. Google TPUs) mirrors the fabless vs. integrated device manufacturer (IDM) models in semiconductors.
*   **Analogy to Operating Systems (OS)**:
    *   This is the most fitting analogy. LLMs are complex software ecosystems, not simple commodities.
    *   The current state is like the **1960s time-sharing era** of computing, with the LLM as the new "CPU" and its context window as "RAM."
    *   The ecosystem is bifurcating into closed-source (like Windows/macOS) and open-source (like Linux) alternatives.
    *   Current chat interfaces are like terminals; a general-purpose **GUI for LLMs** has yet to be invented.

### LLM Psychology and Working with Them

*   LLMs are like **"people spirits"**—stochastic simulations trained on vast amounts of human text, giving them an emergent "psychology."
*   **Superpowers**: They possess **encyclopedic knowledge** and near-perfect memory, similar to a savant.
*   **Cognitive Deficits**:
    *   **Hallucinations**: They can confidently generate false information.
    *   **Jagged intelligence**: They can be superhuman in some areas but fail at simple tasks.
    *   **Anterograde amnesia**: They lack continual learning; their "knowledge" is fixed at training time, and the context window acts as a short-term working memory that gets wiped. (Analogous to *Memento* or *50 First Dates*).
    *   **Gullibility**: They are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks.
*   In summary, an LLM is like a **lossy simulation of a savant with cognitive issues.**

### Opportunities in the New Era

*   **Partial Autonomy LLM Apps**:
    *   The key to successful LLM apps is a fast and efficient **generation-verification loop** between the AI and a human.
    *   **Make verification easy and fast**: Design custom GUIs that leverage human visual intuition.
    *   **Keep AI on a tight leash**: Decompose complex tasks into smaller, auditable steps to increase the probability of successful verification.
*   **The Autonomy Slider**:
    *   A crucial UI/UX pattern for partial autonomy products.
    *   It allows users to dynamically adjust the level of AI control, from simple **augmentation** to fully **agentic** behavior.
    *   Examples include Cursor (coding), Perplexity (research), and Tesla Autopilot (driving).
*   **Building for Agents**:
    *   Treat agents as a new category of "user" for digital information.
    *   **Docs for LLMs**: Create machine-readable documentation (e.g., `llms.txt`, markdown) instead of human-centric, visually formatted docs.
    *   **Actions for LLMs**: Replace human-centric instructions like "click here" with machine-executable actions like `cURL` commands.
*   **Vibe Coding**:
    *   A new method of software creation where developers use natural language to describe their intent, making programming more accessible.
    *   This democratizes software development but highlights that the "last mile" of DevOps (deployment, authentication, etc.) is still a major hurdle.
*   **The Iron Man Suit Analogy**:
    *   The immediate opportunity is not in building fully autonomous "robots" (agents) but in creating "Iron Man suits" (**augmentation**) that enhance human productivity. Over time, the autonomy slider will shift more toward the agentic side.
