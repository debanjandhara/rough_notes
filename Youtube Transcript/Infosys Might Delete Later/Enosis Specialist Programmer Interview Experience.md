## Coding Problems  
### Problem 1: Two Sum Problem  
- **Approach**:  
  1. Start with **Brute Force** (`O(n¬≤)`) using two loops.  
  2. Explain **Hashmap-based Optimized Approach** (`O(n)` complexity).  

### Problem 2: Subset Sum Using Recursion  
- **Task**: Find subsets whose sum equals a given `K`.  
- **Complexity**: Medium to Hard depending on recursion skills.  
- **Steps**:  
  - Write **fully functional code** (not pseudocode).  
  - Discuss **time complexity** and improve with **Dynamic Programming**.  

### Problem 3: Binary Tree BFS Traversal  
- **Task**: Implement Level Order Traversal (BFS).  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Use a **Queue** (Front & Rear access needed).  
  - Clarify why **Stack** isn't suitable.  

### Problem 4: Delete Node in Binary Search Tree  
- **Task**: Delete a node in BST while adhering to BST rules.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Write test cases and handle edge cases.  
  - Syntax errors avoided by focusing on explaining the logic.  

### Problem 5: SQL Queries  
1. **Find Monthly Salary**:  
   - **Table Data**: Annual Salary.  
   - **Solution**: Use **aggregation functions** to calculate monthly salary (`Annual Salary √∑ 12`).  
2. **Second Highest Salary**:  
   - Use **SQL functions** to extract the second highest value.

## Additional Questions  
### Polymorphism  
- **Definition**: Concept in OOP allowing methods to have different forms.  
- **Types**:  
  1. **Compile-time (Static)**: Method Overloading.  
  2. **Runtime (Dynamic)**: Method Overriding.  
- **Real-world Examples**: Explain both types with relatable scenarios.  

---

## Study Recommendations  
- **Must-Know Subjects**:  
  - **DSA**: Practice standard problems using curated sheets like "SD sheet".  
  - **SQL**: Understand aggregation and ranking functions.  
  - **OOPs, CN, DBMS**: Revise core concepts and one-shot notes.  
- **Mock Interviews**: Take practice sessions for better performance.  
- **Key Focus Areas**: Problem-solving skills, theoretical concepts, and communication.

## Tips for Cracking Interviews  
- Practice standard DSA problems multiple times for pattern recognition.  
- Balance theory with practical coding skills.  
- Engage in mock interviews to simulate real scenarios.  
- Improve communication to explain your solutions effectively.
