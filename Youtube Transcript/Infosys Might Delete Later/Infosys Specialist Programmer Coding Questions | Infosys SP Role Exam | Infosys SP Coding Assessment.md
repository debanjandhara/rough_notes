# Infosys Coding Exam Preparation Guide

## Overview
- ðŸ•’ **Time Left**: 2 days remaining.
- ðŸ’¼ **Role & Pay**: Infosys offers ~99.5 LPA for top candidates.
- ðŸš© **Difficulty**: Exam is highly challenging.

## Preparation Strategy
### Coding Questions
1. **Number of Questions**: 3 questions in total.
2. **Key Topics**:
   - **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, **Graphs**, and **Trees**.
   - Focus on your strongest two topics.
3. **Action Plan**:
   - Select your best topics.
   - Practice **pattern-based questions** from **LeetCode** (Medium & Hard).
   - Aim for 10-15 Medium & Hard questions per topic.

### Advanced Topics to Focus
1. **DP**:
   - Practice Medium and Hard-level questions.
2. **Trees**:
   - Cover key patterns and their variations.
3. **Arrays and Strings**:
   - Focus on **calculation-based problems**.
   - Solve Hard-level questions from **LeetCode** and **Codeforces**.
4. **Other Advanced Topics**:
   - **Bit Manipulation**, **Union-Find**, **Priority Queues**.

### Test Cases
1. **Types**:
   - General test cases.
   - Boundary test cases (e.g., minimum values, edge cases).
   - Time limit constraints.
2. **Optimization**:
   - Write optimized code for **less time complexity**.
   - Cover all boundary cases to ensure the solution passes all tests.

### Solving Approach
1. **Understand Questions**:
   - First question: Medium level (LeetCode style).
   - Second & third questions: Hard level.
   - Topics likely include **DP**, **Graphs**, **Trees**, and **Bit Manipulation**.
2. **Practice Hard Questions**:
   - Prioritize Codeforces problems for exam accuracy.
   - Solve at least 25-30 high-quality questions.

## Exam Success Tips
- ðŸŽ¯ **Focus Areas**:
   - Boundary case handling.
   - Time complexity optimization.
   - Advanced problem-solving.
- ðŸ’¡ **Resources**:
   - LeetCode, Codeforces, and video tutorials.
- âœ… **Goals**:
   - Secure at least one question completely.
   - Aim for partial or complete solutions for two more questions.
