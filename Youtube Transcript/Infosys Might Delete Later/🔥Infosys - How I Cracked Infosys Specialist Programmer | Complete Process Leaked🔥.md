  - **Projects**: Focus on relevant and impactful work.
  - **Experience**: Align with the role requirements.

## Technical Preparation
### Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- **Core Topics**: 
  - Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
  - Trees, Binary Search Trees, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming (DP)
  - Priority Queues, Hashmaps, Collections
- **Practice**: Use platforms like LeetCode to solve common problems (e.g., cycle detection in linked lists, palindrome subsequences). 

### Projects
- **Key Points**:
  - Be thorough with your internship and college projects.
  - Highlight technologies/frameworks used in your resume.
  - Prepare to answer detailed questions about implementation and logic.

### Programming Language
- **Preparation Tips**:
