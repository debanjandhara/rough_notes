### Resource Utilization Summary
*Note: This ensures everyone is working ~6-8 hours daily, but with fluctuations mimicking real project dynamics.*

*   **Debanjan (SM + Integ):** Heavy start (Setup), heavy middle (Integration/Review), heavy end (Deployment/Docs). Total ~65 hrs.
*   **Rakshita (Core Features):** Consistently high load due to Tiptap editor and Comment logic. Total ~68 hrs.
*   **Shreya (Auth):** Steady workflow, critical path in Week 1, Admin/Profile in Week 2. Total ~64 hrs.
*   **Anu (Taxonomy/Search):** High load in Week 1 (Uploads/Tags), High load Week 2 (Complex Search). Total ~63 hrs.
*   **Maha (UI/Theme/Metrics):** Balanced mix of Frontend design and specific Backend analytics endpoints. Total ~60 hrs.

### Key "Natural Project" Problems Inserted:
1.  **T-008/009:** The Rich Text Editor (Tiptap) is notoriously hard to customize. Rakshita and Debanjan both spent extra time here on Day 2/3.
2.  **T-016:** CORS error. A classic "it works on my machine" issue that took 3 hours of Debanjan's time on Day 4.
3.  **T-022:** Design refactor. The "GlassCard" looked bad on mobile during the Sprint 1 review, forcing Maha to redo CSS on Day 5.
4.  **T-038:** Performance bug. Anu implemented search, but it spammed the API. She had to add debouncing on Day 10.
