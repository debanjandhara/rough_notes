### **Step 1: Problem Breakdown**

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - An undirected graph is given with `n` nodes and `m` edges.
   - Movement is only allowed along the edges of the graph.

2. **Enjoyment Grid**:
   - A 2D grid `a[i][j]` represents the enjoyment if we stay at node `i` on day `j`.

3. **Goal**:
   - Maximize the total enjoyment over `k` days starting from any node.

4. **Constraints**:
   - Large input size (`n` up to $10^5$, `m` up to $10^5$).
   - Graph traversal needs to be efficient.

### **Step 2: Algorithm Choice**

This problem is similar to:
1. **LeetCode 322** (Coin Change): Optimization of cost/reward over constraints.
2. **LeetCode 1263** (Minimum Moves in Grid): Movement constrained by graph structure.

**Algorithm**: Dynamic Programming + BFS/DFS.
- Use a DP table `dp[i][j]` where:
  - `i` = current node.
  - `j` = current day.
  - `dp[i][j]` = maximum enjoyment obtainable at node `i` on day `j`.

**Transition**:
- `dp[i][j] = max(dp[neighbor][j-1] + a[i][j])` for all neighbors of node `i`.

**Base Case**:
- For day `1`, `dp[i][1] = a[i][1]` for all nodes `i`.

### **Step 3: Implementation Details**

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list for efficient traversal.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Compute the base case for day 1.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Iterate over days `2` to `k` and update `dp` values using the transition formula.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Use a sliding array `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` to reduce space complexity from $O(n \cdot k)$ to $O(n)$.

5. **Result**:
   - Return the maximum value in `dp[node][k]` for all nodes `node`.

### **Step 4: Edge Cases**

1. Disconnected Graph: By constraint, the graph is connected.
2. Minimum size: $n = 1, k = 1$.
3. Large `k`: Ensure DP efficiently handles up to `k = 100`.
4. High enjoyment values: Validate against integer overflow (if applicable).

### **Step 5: Implementation**

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def get_max_enjoyment(n, m, k, edges, enjoyment_grid):
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u - 1].append(v - 1)
        graph[v - 1].append(u - 1)
    
    # Initialize DP arrays
    dp_prev = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp_prev[i] = enjoyment_grid[i][0]  # Day 1
    
    # DP computation for days 2 to k
    for day in range(1, k):
        dp_curr = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            for neighbor in graph[i]:
                dp_curr[i] = max(dp_curr[i], dp_prev[neighbor] + enjoyment_grid[i][day])
        dp_prev = dp_curr  # Move to the next day
    
    # Return the maximum enjoyment after k days
    return max(dp_prev)

# Example Test Cases
n = 2
m = 1
k = 2
edges = [[1, 2]]
enjoyment_grid = [[1, 10], [10, 1]]

print(get_max_enjoyment(n, m, k, edges, enjoyment_grid))  # Output: 20
```

### **Step 6: Complexity Analysis**

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Building adjacency list: $O(m)$.
   - DP computation: $O(k \cdot (n + m))$ since for each day, we iterate over all nodes and neighbors.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - Adjacency list: $O(n + m)$.
   - DP arrays: $O(n)$.

### **Step 7: Additional Optimization**

If `k` is very large, explore mathematical properties (e.g., periodicity or graph diameter) to reduce redundant computation.
