Here's a **versatile prompt** you can use to turn **any experience or event** into a **creative, emotional, humanlike caption**—in **simple, short, and heartfelt words**, without using buzzwords or sounding artificial:

---

**✨ Prompt Template:**

> *"Take the following experience and turn it into a short, emotional, humanlike post caption. Keep the words very simple, raw, and real — like how a person would speak when they’re deeply touched. Avoid buzzwords or clichés. Make it concise, and let it feel like a quiet moment of reflection.*
>
> **Experience**: \[INSERT EXPERIENCE HERE]"\*

### Example (applied to your B.Tech award ceremony):

> **Experience**:
> *"My B.Tech award ceremony. I was in shock. I had just completed 4 years — so much flashed through my head. I worked selflessly for IEM, contributed without expecting anything. And somehow, this award felt like it made it all worth it. The whole auditorium cheered. I was lucky. I didn’t even know what to feel. Just stood there, remembering it all."*

**Resulting Caption** (generated by the above prompt):

> *Still feels unreal. 4 years. So much poured into IEM — not for a title, just for the love of it. And then... this moment. Everyone was there. I was just standing, silent, shocked. It all came back like a movie. I didn’t even smile. I just felt it.*

Would you like me to help you turn this into a reusable automation (e.g., in a Notion template or a script)?
