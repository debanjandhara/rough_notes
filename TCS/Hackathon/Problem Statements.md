## 1. Problem Statement: Predicting Credit Risk for Loan Applicants

### 📌 Background
Financial institutions face significant challenges in assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants. Accurate credit risk prediction is crucial for minimizing defaults and ensuring the stability of the lending system.

The **German Credit dataset** provides a comprehensive set of features related to applicants' financial history, personal information, and loan details, making it an ideal resource for developing predictive models.

### 🎯 Objective
Develop a **machine learning model** to predict the credit risk of loan applicants using the German Credit dataset. The model should:
- Classify applicants into two categories: **Good Credit Risk** and **Bad Credit Risk**.
- Provide insights into key factors influencing credit risk.
- Suggest strategies for improving the credit evaluation process.

### ✅ Requirements

#### 📊 Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of features and the target variable.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and perform data cleaning.
- Engineer new features to enhance model performance.

#### 🧠 Model Development
- Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification.
- Train and validate the model using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- Optimize the model using **hyperparameter tuning** and **cross-validation**.

#### 🔍 Model Interpretation and Insights
- Interpret model predictions and identify the most influential features.
- Create visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations.

#### 🖥️ Presentation
- Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the **methodology**, **results**, and **conclusions**.
- Explain the rationale behind the chosen approach.
- Use **Streamlit** for the UI.
- Submit a **demo recording with voice-over** and the source **code**.

## 2. Problem Statement: Automated Personal Loan Document Processing

### 📌 Background
Banks process numerous personal loan applications, requiring manual data entry and verification from documents like ID proofs, income statements, and bank statements. This manual process is time-consuming and error-prone.

**OCR technology** can automate the extraction of relevant information, improving both **efficiency** and **accuracy**.

### 🎯 Objective
Develop an **OCR-based solution** to:
- Automatically extract and process information from loan application documents.
- Identify key fields such as **applicant name**, **address**, **income details**, and **loan amount**.
- Validate extracted data and integrate with the **bank's loan processing system**.

### ✅ Requirements

#### 📥 Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Collect a sample of personal loan documents in various formats and qualities.
- Preprocess images to enhance readability (e.g., **noise reduction**, **contrast adjustment**).

#### 🔍 OCR Implementation
- Use OCR libraries to extract text.
- Develop algorithms to identify and extract key fields.

#### ✅ Data Validation and Integration
- Implement validation checks for data accuracy.
- Integrate with the bank’s processing system for seamless transfer.

#### 🖥️ User Interface
- Create an interface for uploading and reviewing documents.
- Include options for manual correction of OCR errors.

#### 🖥️ Presentation
- Prepare a comprehensive report covering methodology, results, and conclusions.
- Explain the chosen implementation approach.
- Use **Streamlit** for the UI.
- Submit a **demo recording with voice-over** and the **code**.

## 3. Problem Statement: AI-Powered Insurance Policy Information Chatbot

### 📌 Background
Insurance companies provide multiple policies (health, life, auto, home). Customers often seek clarity on coverage, premiums, and claim processes.

An **AI-powered chatbot** can enhance customer support by delivering timely and accurate information.

### 🎯 Objective
Develop a **chatbot** that:
- Assists customers with queries about insurance policies.
- Understands **natural language**.
- Provides **accurate responses** and guides users through available information.

### ✅ Requirements

#### 🧠 LLM Integration
- Use **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for NLP capabilities.

#### 📚 Knowledge Base Integration
- Create a knowledge base with details of policies, coverage, premiums, and claim processes.
- PDFs can be used as sources to build this knowledge base.
- Ensure the chatbot retrieves and presents relevant content effectively.

#### 💬 Conversation Management
- Implement fallback mechanisms to escalate complex issues to human agents.

#### 🖥️ User Interface
- Design a simple chatbot UI for website/mobile integration.

#### 🖥️ Presentation
- Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the **methodology**, **results**, and **conclusions**.
- Justify the selected implementation.
- Use **Streamlit** for the UI.
- Submit a **demo recording with voice-over** and the **code**.
