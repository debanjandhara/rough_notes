# Audelas Platform - Solution Architecture Progress

**Project:** Audelas - EdTech Platform
**Status as of:** 20-06-2025

This document provides a live overview of the solution architecture drafting process. We have completed the foundational business and feature layers. Our current focus is on defining the technical specifications across the System, UI, API, Data, and Handoff layers.

### Overall Project Status
**Status:** ‚è≥ Technical Specification in Progress
**Overall Progress:** `[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà       ] 29%` (2/7 Documents Complete)

## üî∑ 1. Business Layer
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Progress:** `[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà] 100%`

**What's Done:** We have finalized the foundational "why" behind the Audelas platform. This document defines the core business strategy, including:
*   Primary Business Goals (e.g., Democratize Opportunity, Deliver ROI).
*   Detailed Target User Personas (Students, Institutions, Employers, etc.).
*   A clear Monetization Strategy and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) we will use to measure success.
*   The project's scope for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

**Next Steps:** This document is now considered **finalized**. It will serve as the guiding reference to ensure all subsequent technical work aligns with the core business objectives.

## üî∂ 2. Feature Layer
**Status:** ‚è≥‚úÖ Almost Complete
**Progress:** `[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ] 90%`

**What's Done:** We have translated the business goals into a complete functional specification. This document breaks down *what* the system will do, including:
*   High-level **Feature Epics** and granular **User Stories** (e.g., Student Experience, Marketplace Epic).
*   Detailed **User Interaction Flows** for both successful paths and error scenarios.
*   The logical **Data Models** required (e.g., User, Booking, Review).
*   A full list of **Non-Functional Requirements** (NFRs) covering performance, security, and scalability.

**What's Left:**
* **If any other flow is missing:** Identify and document any additional user interaction flows not yet captured, especially edge cases or role-specific variations.

**Next Steps:** This functional specification is the **source of truth for project scope**. All subsequent technical documents will be built to satisfy these requirements.

## üü© 3. System Layer
**Status:** ‚è≥ In Progress
**Progress:** `[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà   ] 70%`

**What's Done:**
*   The high-level **Microservices Architecture** has been designed.
*   The primary **Technology Stack** has been selected (AWS, Fargate, PostgreSQL).
*   The **System Context Diagram** showing interaction with external services (Stripe, Auth0) is complete.

**What's Left:**
*   **Finalize Inter-Service Communication:** Define the specific event contracts for asynchronous communication via the Event Bus (AWS SNS/SQS).
*   **Detail Observability Strategy:** Specify the key metrics, dashboards, and alert configurations within Datadog for monitoring platform health.
*   **Cloud Cost Estimation:** Prepare a preliminary cost analysis for the proposed AWS infrastructure to support budget planning.

## üü¶ 4. UI/UX Layer
**Status:** ‚è≥ In Progress
**Progress:** `[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà      ] 40%`

**What's Done:**
*   A comprehensive **list of essential pages and screens** has been compiled.
*   Initial **User Navigation Flows** for primary journeys (e.g., student booking a session) have been mapped out.
*   Textual wireframes for **three key pages** (Student Dashboard, Institution Dashboard, Search Results) are drafted.

**What's Left:**
*   **Complete Textual Wireframes:** Draft wireframes for all remaining pages, especially for the Admin, Facilitator, and Employer sections.
*   **Detail State Management:** Document how UI state (e.g., loading, error, empty) will be handled on critical pages.
*   **Accessibility Notes:** Add specific accessibility (a11y) considerations and requirements for each page and component.

## üü™ 5. API Layer
**Status:** ‚è≥ In Progress
**Progress:** `[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà    ] 60%`

**What's Done:**
*   The RESTful endpoint structure for **core entities** (Users, Programs, Jobs, Bookings) has been defined.
*   **Authentication and role requirements** for key API routes are established.
*   Sample request/response payloads for a few critical endpoints have been created.

**What's Left:**
*   **Finalize All Schemas:** Complete the request/response schemas for every single endpoint.
*   **Error Handling & Status Codes:** Define a standardized list of API error responses and HTTP status codes.
*   **Document Pagination:** Formalize the structure for paginated responses across all `GET` list endpoints.
*   **Draft OpenAPI Specification:** Begin creating the `openapi.yml` file which will serve as the single source of truth for the API.

## üü• 6. Data Layer
**Status:** ‚è≥ In Progress
**Progress:** `[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà  ] 80%`

**What's Done:**
*   The full **PostgreSQL database schema**, including tables, columns, and relationships, has been designed.
*   Primary and foreign keys, along with initial indexes, have been specified.
*   A **Data Dictionary** explaining key fields has been created.

**What's Left:**
*   **Schema Review:** Conduct a final review of the schema to identify any potential performance bottlenecks or normalization issues.
*   **Detail Migration Plan:** Flesh out the step-by-step process for running migrations using the chosen tool (e.g., Flyway, Alembic).
*   **Define Seeding Strategy:** Specify exactly what sample data is needed for development and testing environments and finalize the seeding script plan.

## üì¶ 7. Dev Handoff Assets
**Status:** ‚è≥ In Progress
**Progress:** `[‚ñà‚ñà        ] 20%`

**What's Done:**
*   The overall structure for the handoff package has been outlined.
*   **Example technical stories** (JIRA/Linear tickets) have been drafted to serve as a template for the development team.

**What's Left:**
*   **Create Full MVP Backlog:** Write the initial set of user stories and technical tasks required for the MVP to populate the project management tool.
*   **Finalize `README.md`:** Complete the detailed environment setup guide once all technology choices in the System Layer are 100% locked.
*   **Generate API Collection:** Create the Postman collection from the finalized OpenAPI specification.
