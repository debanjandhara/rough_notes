### ðŸ“¦ 7. Dev Handoff Assets

This section outlines the final set of deliverables designed to bridge the gap between planning and implementation. These assets provide the development team with a clear, structured, and actionable starting point.

### 7.1. Technical Stories (JIRA / Linear Ticket Examples)

This is a breakdown of how the features and requirements translate into granular development tasks, organized by epics and user stories. Each story should have clear acceptance criteria.

**Epic: [Marketplace] - Core Booking Flow**

*   **Story 1: [FE/BE] View Facilitator Profile & Services**
    *   **Description:** As a student, I want to view a facilitator's public profile and the list of services they offer so that I can decide if they are the right fit for me.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A new page is created at `/facilitators/{id}`.
        *   The page displays the facilitator's name, bio, avatar, and average star rating.
        *   A list of services is displayed, each with a title, description, duration, and price.
        *   Data is fetched from the `GET /api/v1/facilitators/{id}` and `GET /api/v1/facilitators/{id}/services` endpoints.
        *   The page is responsive and displays correctly on mobile and desktop.

*   **Story 2: [FE/BE] Book a Service**
    *   **Description:** As a student, I want to select a service, choose an available time slot, and confirm my booking so that I can secure a session with a facilitator.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Clicking "Book" on a service opens a calendar view showing the facilitator's availability.
        *   The student can select a time slot, which leads to a confirmation/payment screen.
        *   The frontend makes a `POST /api/v1/bookings` request with the correct payload.
        *   On success, the user is redirected to a confirmation page.
        *   On failure, a user-friendly error message is displayed.

*   **Story 3: [BE] Process Booking Payment**
    *   **Description:** As the system, I need to securely process a payment via Stripe when a student confirms a booking.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The `POST /bookings` endpoint receives a one-time payment token from the client.
        *   The backend Payment Service uses the Stripe SDK to create a charge.
        *   If the charge is successful, the booking status in the database is set to `confirmed`.
        *   If the charge fails, a `400 Bad Request` error is returned with an appropriate error code.
        *   The transaction details are logged in the `transactions` table.

*   **Story 4: [BE] Send Booking Confirmation Notifications**
    *   **Description:** As the system, I need to send confirmation emails to both the student and the facilitator after a booking is successfully confirmed.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The Booking Service publishes a `BookingConfirmed` event to the event bus.
        *   The Notification Service consumes this event.
        *   An email template for the student is populated with booking details (facilitator name, time, etc.) and sent.
        *   A separate email template for the facilitator is populated and sent.

### 7.3. Environment Setup Guide (for a new developer's `README.md`)

This guide ensures any developer can get the project running locally with minimal friction.

```markdown
# Audelas Platform - Local Development Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up the Audelas platform for local development.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- AWS CLI, configured with dev account credentials
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Audelas/audelas-platform.git
cd audelas-platform
```

## 2. Environment Variables
Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Now, open the `.env` file and fill in the required secrets. Obtain these from the project lead or your team's password manager:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your local PostgreSQL connection string.
- `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`: Auth0 credentials for development.
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Stripe API key for the test environment.
- `...` (other necessary keys)

## 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
# For the frontend web application
cd web
npm install

# For backend services (example for booking-service)
cd ../services/booking-service
npm install
```

## 4. Run Backend Services with Docker Compose
From the root directory, start the database and all backend services:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will:
- Spin up a PostgreSQL container.
- Run database migrations and seed the database.
- Start all microservices, which will be accessible on their respective ports.

## 5. Run the Frontend
In a separate terminal, start the web application:
```bash
cd web
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key URLs for Development
- **Web App:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **API Gateway:** `http://localhost:8080`
- **Auth0 Dashboard:** `https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/...`
- **Stripe Test Dashboard:** `https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/...`
```

### 7.4. API Reference (Postman / Swagger)

This is the definitive, interactive documentation for the API layer.

*   **Format:** **OpenAPI 3.0 Specification**
*   **Location:** The specification will be maintained in a single YAML file at `/docs/api/openapi.yml` in the codebase.
*   **Tooling:**
    1.  **Swagger UI:** The CI/CD pipeline will automatically deploy a hosted instance of Swagger UI (e.g., at `https://api.audelas.com/docs`). This tool renders the `openapi.yml` file into interactive, user-friendly documentation where developers can read about endpoints and even try them out directly in the browser.
    2.  **Postman Collection:** The `openapi.yml` file will be used to automatically generate a Postman Collection. This collection will be exported and shared with the development team, allowing them to easily test API endpoints from their local machines with pre-configured requests, headers, and environment variables.

**Benefits of this approach:**
*   **Single Source of Truth:** The `openapi.yml` in the codebase is the master document. All other forms of API documentation are generated from it.
*   **Automation:** Documentation and testing tools are automatically updated as the API evolves.
*   **Collaboration:** Provides a clear, unambiguous contract between frontend, backend, and QA teams.
