```
**Description of Flow:**
*   **Users** interact with the **Audelas Platform** through its web and mobile applications.
*   **Audelas Platform** communicates with external systems to offload specific, complex functionalities:
    *   **Authentication:** It directs users to providers like **Auth0** for secure login (OAuth, password) and receives user identity tokens in return.
    *   **Payments:** It sends payment requests to **Stripe** for marketplace transactions and receives success or failure responses.
    *   **Notifications:** It sends formatted email payloads to **SendGrid** for reliable delivery to users.
    *   **Search:** It pushes data (programs, jobs, profiles) to **Algolia** to create a searchable index and then queries Algolia to power its platform-wide search features.
    *   **Research Integration:** It pulls data from academic APIs like the **Open Science Framework** to enrich research profiles and content.

### 3.2. Component Architecture (Microservices / Modules)

The Audelas platform will be built using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and independent development for different domains.

| Service Name | Responsibilities | Key Dependencies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Gateway** | A single, unified entry point for all client requests. Handles request routing, authentication checks, rate limiting, and some payload transformation. | Auth Service, and all other backend services. |
| **Auth Service** | Manages user identities, registration, login/logout, and token generation/validation. Acts as a liaison with external auth providers (Auth0). | User Service |
| **User Service** | Manages user profiles, roles, permissions, and persona-specific data (e.g., student interests, facilitator expertise). The source of truth for user information. | Auth Service |
| **Program Service** | Manages all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for educational programs and institution profiles. | User Service (for institution owner), Search Service (for indexing) |
| **Job Service** | Manages all CRUD operations for job, internship, and gig postings, along with employer profiles. | User Service (for employer), Search Service (for indexing) |
| **Marketplace Service** | Manages service listings from facilitators, facilitator profiles, and reputation data (reviews, ratings). | User Service (for facilitator details), Booking Service |
| **Booking Service** | Manages the entire lifecycle of a booking: scheduling, state transitions (`pending`, `confirmed`, `completed`), and orchestrating payments. | User Service, Marketplace Service, Payment Service, Notification Service |
| **Payment Service** | A dedicated service that acts as an anti-corruption layer for the Stripe API. It handles payment intent creation, processing, and refund logic. | Booking Service |
| **Notification Service** | Centralizes all communication logic. It generates and sends notifications (in-app, email, push) based on events from other services. | All services can publish events to it (e.g., `booking_confirmed`). |
| **Analytics Service** | Consumes events from across the platform (e.g., `user_registered`, `program_saved`, `booking_completed`) to calculate and expose metrics for the various dashboards (SAC, CPH). | Data Warehouse, Event Bus |
| **Search Service** | Integrates with the external search provider (Algolia). It receives data from other services (Program, Job, User) and indexes it for fast, full-text search. | Program Service, Job Service, User Service |

**Inter-Service Communication:**
*   **Synchronous:** Services communicate via RESTful API calls through the internal network for direct request/response needs (e.g., Booking Service getting user details from User Service).
*   **Asynchronous:** Services communicate via an **Event Bus** (e.g., AWS SNS/SQS, RabbitMQ) for decoupled, event-driven workflows (e.g., when a booking is confirmed, the Booking Service publishes a `BookingConfirmed` event, which the Notification Service and Analytics Service subscribe to).

### 3.3. Infrastructure & Technology Stack

The following technology stack is proposed to meet the platform's non-functional requirements for scalability, reliability, and security.

| Category | Technology Choice | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud Provider** | **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** | Provides a mature, comprehensive suite of managed services that align perfectly with our architectural needs, enabling rapid development and scaling. |
| **Compute** | â€¢ **AWS Fargate (Containers)** <br> â€¢ **AWS Lambda (Serverless)** | **Fargate** offers a serverless container orchestration solution, ideal for running our microservices without managing underlying servers. **Lambda** is perfect for event-driven, short-lived tasks (e.g., processing an image upload, running a scheduled job). |
| **Primary Database** | **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL** | A robust, managed relational database ideal for our structured data (users, bookings, programs). RDS handles patching, backups, and scaling. |
| **Data Warehouse** | **Amazon Redshift** | A columnar database optimized for the complex analytical queries required by our Analytics Service, without impacting the performance of our primary transactional database. |
| **Object Storage** | **Amazon S3** | Highly durable, scalable, and cost-effective storage for user-generated content like resumes, profile pictures, portfolios, and research documents. |
| **Authentication** | **Auth0** | A specialized Identity-as-a-Service platform that handles complex security features (MFA, passwordless, social logins) out-of-the-box, accelerating development and enhancing security. |
| **Search Indexing** | **Algolia** | A high-performance, developer-friendly Search-as-a-Service that provides fast, relevant search results and advanced filtering capabilities with minimal operational overhead. |
| **Event Bus** | **AWS SNS + SQS** | A reliable, highly scalable, and fully managed pub/sub messaging system for asynchronous communication between our microservices, enabling resilient and decoupled architecture. |
| **CI/CD & DevOps** | â€¢ **Code:** GitHub <br> â€¢ **Pipeline:** GitHub Actions | A tightly integrated toolchain. **GitHub** for version control. **GitHub Actions** to automate building, testing, and deploying our containerized services to AWS Fargate on every commit to the main branch. |
| **Monitoring & Observability** | **Datadog** | A unified platform that combines infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring (APM), log management, and alerting. This provides a single pane of glass to ensure our platform's health and reliability. |
