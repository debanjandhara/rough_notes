### 1.1. Business Goals

The primary strategic objectives Audelas aims to achieve.

1.  **Democratize Opportunity:** Break down systemic barriers in the education-to-employment journey, making access to programs, careers, and guidance fair, transparent, and based on merit, not just background or connections.
2.  **Create a Unified, Frictionless Ecosystem:** Integrate the entire user journeyâ€”from program discovery and academic research to career alignment and hiringâ€”into a single, seamless platform, eliminating the need for fragmented, single-purpose solutions.
3.  **Deliver Measurable ROI for Partners:** Provide institutions and employers with actionable intelligence (e.g., SAC, CPH) and a closed feedback loop to optimize recruitment, reduce costs, improve talent matching, and prove the value of their programs and hiring efforts.
4.  **Build a Defensible, High-Value Network:** Become an indispensable and "sticky" platform through progressive value accumulation (data network effects), ensuring that every interaction makes the ecosystem smarter, more personalized, and more valuable for all participants.

### 1.5. Monetization Strategy

The plan for generating revenue across the platform's user groups.

| User Group | Revenue Model | Description / Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

### 1.7. Competitive Landscape & Market Positioning

How Audelas fits into the market and what makes it unique.

*   **Competitor Categories:**
    *   **College Discovery & Admissions:** Common App, Naviance, CollegeVine
    *   **Entry-Level Job Platforms:** Handshake, WayUp, LinkedIn
    *   **Academic Networks:** ResearchGate, Academia.edu
    *   **Institutional CRMs:** Slate, Blackbaud, Ellucian
*   **Market Positioning & Unique Differentiator:**
    Audelas is the **only unified, multi-sided ecosystem** that connects all stakeholders across the entire education-to-employment journey. Unlike point solutions that address only admissions or only jobs, Audelas integrates these silos and creates a **closed-loop feedback system**. This provides unprecedented, actionable ROI data (SAC, CPH, ROH) to our partners, while delivering a continuous, high-value experience for students from discovery to their first job and beyond. Our foundation of **ethical design and trust** further distinguishes us from purely transactional or data-harvesting platforms.

### 1.8. High-Level Business Rules & Constraints

The fundamental operational, ethical, and legal guardrails for the platform.

1.  **Ethical Contribution is Non-Negotiable:** The platform must have built-in mechanisms (e.g., contribution logs, attribution systems) to prevent intellectual property theft and ensure fair credit, especially in research collaborations.
2.  **Privacy by Design:** User data is used to provide value *back* to the user, not just for harvesting. Users must have clear control over their data visibility and sharing.
3.  **Reputation-Gated Participation:** Access to key marketplace features (e.g., paid advising) is gated by achieving a minimum reputation score, ensuring quality and trust.
4.  **Moderation and Safety:** The platform will enforce community guidelines to prevent abuse, spam, and low-quality content, particularly in community and matching features.
5.  **Transparency is Default:** Disclosures for conflicts of interest and funding sources on research projects are mandatory to maintain academic and platform integrity.
