### Summary of the Talk: Attacking Plagiarism Detectors

#### 1. **Problem Statement** üõ†Ô∏è
- Plagiarism in computer science assignments is a prevalent issue in universities.
- Manual inspection of assignments is impractical due to high student-to-TA ratios and increased CS enrollment.
- Heavy reliance on plagiarism detection tools (e.g., Moss, JPLAG, Sherlock) to identify cheating.

#### 2. **How Plagiarism Detectors Work** üñ•Ô∏è
- **Normalization**: Code is preprocessed by renaming identifiers, removing comments, and formatting.

- **Tokenization and Fingerprinting**:
  - Code is tokenized and converted into a set of fingerprints (e.g., n-grams, string tiling, or hash-based methods).
  - Tools compare fingerprints to assign similarity scores.
- Moss features:
  - Highlights similar lines using color.
  - Detects typical plagiarism techniques like identifier renaming, comment addition/removal, and code rearrangement.

#### 3. **The MOSSAD System** üö®
- **Purpose**: Enables students to bypass plagiarism detection tools.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Generates semantically equivalent variants of code with near-zero similarity scores.
  - Produces multiple distinct variants from a single source file.
  - Effective across all tested plagiarism detectors.

#### 4. **Core Techniques of MOSSAD** üîß
- **Fingerprint Disruption**: Modifies code to ensure fingerprints do not collide.
  - Example: Inserts variable declarations or existing code snippets in innocuous ways.
- **Semantic Preservation**: Ensures all modifications retain the original program‚Äôs functionality.
  - Verifies equivalence using compilation and optimization checks.

#### 5. **Research Findings** üìä
- **Effectiveness**:
  - 100% of MOSSAD files scored below the average authentic similarity score.
  - Enables mass plagiarism with low inter-variant similarity (‚â§25%).
- **TA Spot Checks**:
  - TAs failed to detect MOSSAD-modified files as suspicious.
  - MOSSAD code had comparable readability and design scores to authentic code.
- **Cross-Tool Testing**: MOSSAD bypassed all tested plagiarism detectors.

#### 6. **Partial Countermeasures** üõ°Ô∏è
- **Compile to Assembly**: Compare assembly outputs instead of source code; increases similarity scores to ~80%.
- **Pedagogical Changes**:
  - Integrate GitHub to monitor commits.
  - Use code reviews to assess student understanding.

#### 7. **Conclusion** üìå
- **Plagiarism Detectors' Flaws**:
  - Focus on syntactic features rather than semantic equivalence.
  - Vulnerable to systematic attacks like MOSSAD.
- **Call to Action**:
  - Re-evaluate reliance on current tools.
  - Invest in advanced, semantic-based detection methods.
  - Enhance academic integrity through better pedagogical practices.
