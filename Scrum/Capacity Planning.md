Here is the **Capacity Planning** for both sprints.

**Logic used for calculation:**
*   **Standard Day:** 8 Hours.
*   **Ceremonies (5 hours/person):** Includes Sprint Planning (2h), Daily Standups (15m x 5 days), Sprint Review (1h), Sprint Retrospective (1h).
*   **Buffer Time (12.5%):** Allocated for emails, breaks, context switching, and unexpected "fires" (approx 1 hour per person, per day).
*   **Net Available Time:** This is the actual time available for coding/testing tasks (matches the ~30 hours/person workload in the Scrum Sheet).
