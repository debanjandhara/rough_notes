This sheet represents the **Sprint Retrospective** meeting data. This meeting happens at the end of every sprint to discuss what went well and what didn't.

Since you have two sprints, I have divided the table into two sections.

### Sprint Retrospective Log

| SL | Sprint No | Start Date | End Date | Team Member | Start Doing | Stop Doing | Continue Doing | Action Taken |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Sprint 1** | **18-Nov** | **22-Nov** | **Debanjan** | **Code Reviews:** We need to review PRs before merging. The massive merge conflict on Day 5 killed 3 hours. | **Direct Pushes:** Pushing directly to the `main` branch without checking if others pushed code. | **Helping Others:** Jumping in to help Rakshita with Tiptap was great, kept us on track. | Implemented Branch Protection rules on GitHub; Pull Requests (PRs) now require 1 approval. |
| **2** | **Sprint 1** | **18-Nov** | **22-Nov** | **Shreya** | **API Standardization:** Define exactly what the backend error response looks like (e.g., `{ error: "msg" }` vs `{ message: "msg" }`). | **Assuming:** Guessing the HTTP status codes. I waited too long to ask Debanjan about 401/403 errors. | **Auth Testing:** Testing the login flow early saved us integration headaches later. | Created a `responseHelper.js` on Backend to ensure all errors return a standard JSON format. |
| **3** | **Sprint 1** | **18-Nov** | **22-Nov** | **Rakshita** | **Reading Docs:** I should read the library documentation (Tiptap) thoroughly before starting to code. | **Hardcoding:** Stop hardcoding the user ID in the `Post` model; it broke when we switched users. | **UI Components:** Reusing the `Button` component Shreya made was efficient. | Rakshita will spend the first 2 hours of Sprint 2 reading up on Recharts docs before coding. |
| **4** | **Sprint 1** | **18-Nov** | **22-Nov** | **Anu** | **Naming Conventions:** We need to agree on file naming. Some use `camelCase`, some `PascalCase` for files. | **Ignoring Case:** Stop ignoring case sensitivity in Tags (e.g., "Tech" vs "tech"). | **Daily Commits:** Pushing code at end of day helped back up my work. | Debanjan added a `lint` script to `package.json` to enforce file naming conventions. |
| **5** | **Sprint 1** | **18-Nov** | **22-Nov** | **Maha** | **Responsive Checks:** Check mobile view while developing, not just at the end. | **Over-styling:** Stop writing custom CSS when Tailwind utility classes can do the job faster. | **Theme Context:** The dark/light mode toggle architecture works perfectly. | Installed a "Mobile Simulator" browser extension to check responsiveness during development. |
| | | | | | | | | |
| **6** | **Sprint 2** | **25-Nov** | **29-Nov** | **Debanjan** | **Performance Testing:** Check bundle size earlier. The app was huge until we optimized it on the last day. | **Last Minute Configs:** Changing environment variables 1 hour before the demo. | **Deployment:** Setting up the Render pipeline early (Day 10) was a life saver. | Added a "Bundle Analyzer" plugin to Vite config to keep track of file sizes for future projects. |
| **7** | **Sprint 2** | **25-Nov** | **29-Nov** | **Shreya** | **Edge Case Testing:** Test what happens when a user is deleted but their posts remain. | **Ignoring Security:** Returning full user objects (including password hashes) in API responses. | **Admin Features:** The Admin panel flow was very smooth and bug-free. | Updated the `User` model `toJSON` method to automatically strip password fields from responses. |
| **8** | **Sprint 2** | **25-Nov** | **29-Nov** | **Rakshita** | **Optimistic UI:** Show the comment immediately after clicking "Post" instead of waiting for reload. | **Heavy Assets:** Stop uploading 5MB images for blog headers; it slows down the Dashboard. | **Integration:** The integration with the backend `comment` API was seamless. | Implemented client-side image compression before upload to keep images under 1MB. |
| **9** | **Sprint 2** | **25-Nov** | **29-Nov** | **Anu** | **Debouncing:** Handle search input efficiency from the start, not as a bug fix. | **Complex Regex:** Stop trying to make one Regex do everything; split the logic if needed. | **Collaboration:** Working with Maha on the Filters UI was very productive. | Created a reusable `useDebounce` hook in the `hooks/` folder for future search inputs. |
| **10** | **Sprint 2** | **25-Nov** | **29-Nov** | **Maha** | **Data Transformation:** Ask Backend to send data in the format the Chart library needs. | **Manual Mocking:** Stop using mock data in components once the real API is ready. | **Polishing:** The final UI polish (animations, shadows) really sold the demo. | Agreed that for future projects, Backend and Frontend will agree on JSON Schema before coding starts. |
